Great to reunite with **MISTLab** at **IROS 2025**.

<!--more-->

During IROS 2025 in Hangzhou (October 19–25), FAST-FIRE Lab reunited with **MISTLab** from Polytechnique Montréal. We hosted Prof. **Giovanni Beltrame** and his team at the ZJU Huzhou Institute, where we showcased our tracked vehicle, aerial–ground UAV platforms, and our air–ground multi-robot collaboration system.

**About MISTLab:** The *Making Innovative Space Technology Lab* (MISTLab) at Polytechnique Montréal, led by Prof. Giovanni Beltrame, focuses on multi-robot systems and swarm robotics, autonomous perception–planning–control, embedded AI, and field deployments across aerial, ground, and space platforms. The group collaborates broadly with academia and industry and actively shares open-source tools and research outcomes with the community.
