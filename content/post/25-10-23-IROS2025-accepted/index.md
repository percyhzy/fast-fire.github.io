Terrain analysis is critical for deploying ground mobile robots in real-world tasks, especially in outdoor, unstructured environments. In this paper, we propose a novel **spatio-temporal traversability assessment** method that enables autonomous robots to navigate complex terrains effectively. Our approach uses **sparse Gaussian processes (SGP)** to extract geometric features (curvature, gradient, elevation, etc.) directly from point-cloud scans, which are then fused into a high-resolution local traversability map. We further design a **spatio-temporal Bayesian Gaussian kernel (BGK)** inference method to dynamically evaluate traversability scores by integrating historical and real-time data while accounting for slope, flatness, gradient, and uncertainty. With GPU-accelerated feature extraction, the system achieves real-time performance. Extensive simulation studies across diverse terrain scenarios show that our method outperforms **state-of-the-art (SOTA)** baselines in both accuracy and computational efficiency. Finally, we build an autonomous navigation framework around the traversability map and validate it on a differential-drive platform in complex outdoor environments. Our code will be open-sourced at [github.com/ZJU-FAST-Lab/FSGP_BGK](https://github.com/ZJU-FAST-Lab/FSGP_BGK).

During IROS 2025 in Hangzhou (October 19–25), in the **Mapping** track, Zhenyu Hou delivered an excellent oral presentation that sparked lively discussions among many **field robotics** experts. As one of the flagship, top-tier conferences in robotics alongside ICRA, **IROS (IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems)** brings together the global academic and industrial communities each year, covering frontiers such as perception, planning, control, and embodied intelligence. The 2025 conference was held at the **Hangzhou International Expo Center (HIEC)**, further showcasing China’s vitality and influence in intelligent robotics.
