## Demo Overview
- **Scenario:** GPS-denied, global-localization-free cooperation between an aerial robot and a tracked ground vehicle.  
- **Core capability:** Robust **relative localization** with coordinated planning/control for shared tasks.  
- **System stack:** **CREPES** (perception & estimation) and **CoNi-MPC** (cooperative nonlinear model predictive control).  
- **Platforms:** **RoFly** (UAV) and **CubeTrack** (tracked UGV).

## Key Takeaways
- Stable tracking and re-acquisition despite occlusions and dynamic crowd movement.  
- Consistent performance under expo-floor lighting and environmental disturbances.  
- Fast, repeatable demo cycles suitable for continuous public demonstrations.

## Event Details
- **Conference:** IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS 2025) — **EXPO**  
- **Dates:** October 21–23, 2025  
- **Venue:** Hangzhou International Expo Center
