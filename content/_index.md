       Welcome to the **Center of Swarm Navigation(CSN)** at **Huzhou Institute of Zhejiang University**. We are also the **Field Intelligent Robotics Engineering (FIRE)** group of the **Field Autonomous System and Computing Lab (FAST Lab)**. Our mission is to create fully intelligent robot teams that are capable of operating in complex and diverse environments to tackle real-world challenges. We are fascinated by novel robotic concepts and excited about pushing the boundaries of robotics' potential to demonstrate remarkable capabilities. More specifically, our research interests cover multi-robot cooperation, novel robot platforms, and autonomous navigation. We also have a spin-off company dedicated to accelerating the translation of our research achievements into the commercial market, solving real-world tasks, and completing the R&D cycle.
